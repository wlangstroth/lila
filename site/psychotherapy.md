<p>There are times in everyone's life when events or experiences overwhelm our ability to cope, and we turn to those around us for help and support. Sometimes, though, talking to a professional is the best option. Psychotherapy can provide dedicated support during times of stress and struggle, helping you take care of yourself and start feeling better.</p>
<p>I work with clients who are facing a wide range of personal, relational and emotional challenges. No two people are alike, even if their struggles are similar. My practice is grounded in a respect for this individuality.</p></p>
<p>Our work together begins in getting to know you, your circumstances, and what you need to feel like you are moving forward. From there we keep talking, deepening our understanding of who you are, making space for feelings and thoughts, and opening up the possibilities for acceptance and meaningful change.</p></p>
