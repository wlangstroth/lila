    <a name='right'><h2> How will I know if you're the right psychotherapist for me?</h2></a>
    <p>It's important to find a psychotherapist that you feel comfortable and optimistic about working with. "Fit" or "rapport" is a big part of what makes psychotherapy effective. I offer a free consultation for this reason.  After we've met and you've had an opportunity to ask me some questions, you'll have a better feel for whether I'm a good fit for you.</p>
    <a name='sessions'><h2>How many sessions will I need?</h2></a>
    <p>There is no standard answer to this question. The length of a psychotherapy depends on many things, including the issue or concern that the client wants to work on, their goals, the pace they prefer, the therapist's approach, and more. If you are entering psychotherapy with a sense of how many sessions you want or can realistically commit to, please let me know.  With these limits in mind we can discuss and plan for how to best use the time we have available.</p>
    <a name='covered'><h2>Is psychotherapy covered by insurance?</h2></a>
    <p>Psychotherapy services provided by a RSW (Registered Social Worker) are not covered by Ontario Health Insurance (OHIP) but may be covered or partially covered by extended health benefits. If you have a benefits plan, contact the provider or your human resources department at work to learn more about your coverage.</p>
    <a name='cost'><h2>How much does psychotherapy cost?</h2></a>
    <p>My standard fee for a 55 minute psychotherapy session is $120. Payments can be made in cash, by personal cheque, or through an email money transfer.</p>
    <a name='sliding'><h2>Do you offer sliding scale rates?</h2></a>
    <p>I have a limited number of weekday daytime sliding scale spaces available for clients who do not have the financial means to cover my full fee. Please contact me to find out if I currently have sliding scale availability or to ask to  be put on a wait list.</p>
    <a name='makeit'><h2>What if I can't make it to my appointment?</h2></a>
    <p>As with many other professional services, you may cancel or reschedule up to 24 hours before your appointment. Short notice cancellations and missed appointments will be billed at full fee (with cancellations due to emergencies excepted).</p>
    <a name='confidential'><h2>Is psychotherapy confidential?</h2></a>
    <p>As a Registered Social Worker, my professional code of ethics requires me to keep your personal information, including what is discussed in our sessions, strictly confidential. This means that the only times I would disclose any client's information is when the law requires me to do so, or when I have the client's informed and written consent. There are very few cases when the law would require me to break confidentially. If I assess that there is a clear and immanent risk of suicide, homicide, or serious harm to the client or someone else, if I have reason to believe that a child is being abused or neglected, or if the court subpoenas client records, then I am legally and ethically obligated to report to the proper authorities.</p>
    <p>Beyond these exceptions, the only time that I would discuss any elements of a client's case is in the context of clinical supervision or consultation.  Supervision and consultation are, in my opinion, integral to providing an effective and ethical psychotherapy service.  I am supervised by an experienced clinician on a regular basis, and seek expert consultation when I feel it is necessary and have the client's permission to do so. In supervision and consultation, cases are reviewed in a non-identifying way and only with another clinician who shares the same professional obligation to maintain client confidentiality.</p>
    <p>In your first psychotherapy session you will receive detailed information on confidentiality and its limits, including a document that you can review at home.</p>
