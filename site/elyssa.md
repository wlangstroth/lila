Elyssa Caterini is currently completing her Masters in Counselling Psychology at Yorkville University.  She will be providing sliding scale and pro bono counselling under Lila's supervision until August 2021.

Elyssa is committed to creating a safe, collaborative, non-judgemental space for her clients to discuss whatever brings them to seek counselling.  Her approach is client-centered and grounded in cognitive-behavioural approaches to making meaningful change.  She welcomes clients experiencing stress, anxiety, overwhelm, low mood, sleep difficulties, and/ or pandemic related stress to reach out to her to book a consultation appointment.
